- **Anomaly detection** for user behavior
- **Failed authentication monitoring**
- **Data access pattern analysis**
- **Performance monitoring** for security impact

### Audit Logging
```typescript
// Security event logging
interface SecurityEvent {
  timestamp: string;
  userId?: string;
  sessionId: string;
  event: 'login' | 'data_access' | 'permission_change' | 'export' | 'deletion';
  result: 'success' | 'failure' | 'blocked';
  metadata: {
    ipAddress: string;
    userAgent: string;
    location?: string;
    riskScore: number;
  };
}
```

## 🏥 Healthcare-Specific Security

### Patient Data Protection
- **Data minimization**: Collect only necessary information
- **Pseudonymization**: Patient identifiers are anonymized
- **Access logging**: All patient data access is logged
- **Retention policies**: Automatic data deletion after 7 years
- **Export controls**: Secure data portability options

### Medical Device Security
- **FDA guidance compliance** (when applicable)
- **IEC 62304** software lifecycle processes
- **Risk management** per ISO 14971

// Compliance checking
interface ComplianceCheck {
  regulation: 'HIPAA' | 'LGPD' | 'FDA' | 'ISO27001';
  requirement: string;
  status: 'compliant' | 'non_compliant' | 'pending';
  lastAudit: Date;
  nextAudit: Date;
  evidence: string[];
}
```

## 🔄 Incident Response

### Security Incident Classification
- **P0 - Critical**: Data breach, system compromise
- **P1 - High**: Authentication bypass, privilege escalation
- **P2 - Medium**: Information disclosure, injection flaws
- **P3 - Low**: Configuration issues, low-impact vulnerabilities

### Response Timeline
```
P0: 1 hour detection → 2 hours response → 4 hours containment
P1: 4 hours detection → 8 hours response → 24 hours containment
P2: 24 hours detection → 3 days response → 1 week resolution
P3: 1 week detection → 2 weeks response → 1 month resolution
```

### Incident Response Team
- **Security Lead**: Overall incident coordination
- **Technical Lead**: Technical analysis and remediation
- **Legal Counsel**: Regulatory compliance and notifications
- **Communications**: Internal and external communications
- **DevOps**: Infrastructure and deployment support
